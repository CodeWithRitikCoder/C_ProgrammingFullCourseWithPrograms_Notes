    /*What is Preprocessor in C programming language ?
        *-> C preprocessor comes under action before the actual compilation process.
        *-> C preprocessor is not a part of the C compiler.
        *-> It is text substitution tool.
        *-> All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#).
     
    Preprocessor commands in C programming.
        *-> #define
         *-> It is used to define macro and create variables of preprocessor.
        *-> #include
        *-> #undef
            *-> It is used to Undefines a macro.
        *-> #ifdef
            *-> It is used when your have defined a macro.
        *-> #ifndef
            *-> It is used when your have not defined a macro.
        *-> #if
            *-> .......
        *-> #else
            *-> .......
        *-> #elif
            *-> .......
        *-> #pragma
            *-> It is used when issue some special commands to the compiler.
        *-> Predefined macros.
            *-> It is already defined macros.

    What is preprocessor directive in other words.
        *-> Preprocessor is a kind of automated editor that modifies a copy of the orginal source code.
        *-> The #include directive causes the preprocessor to fetch the contents of some other file to be included in the present file.
        *-> In C programming there are two common formats for #includes:
        *-> This file may in turn #include some other file(s) which may in turn do the same.
        *-> Most commonly the #included files have a ".h"extension, indicating that they are header files.
        *-> The #define directive derective is used to *define" Preprocessor "variable" 
    
    let's discss all these preprocessor command seperately .c files.
